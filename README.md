# Final Project

Our app is currently running at http://54.153.10.237:4000
Docker will require the images to be made with:
```bash
$ sudo docker build -f devops/<name>.Dockerfile -t dfw/<name> .
```
for each Dockerfile inside devops

We are going to continue working on this after noon to try to get our last bugs ironed out, but there is a commit at 12 which you can use if you want to see our work by that hard deadline.

Thanks,
Down For Whatever Team.
